### DotGifIt

A simple screen recorder made in java. This application will create a directory called DotGifIt in your 
user.home! This file contains config info and can be edited directly or using the application.

## To run

Should be directly runnable from an IDE but would advise the following to run without that overhead. Assuming 
the user has Maven installed.

```bash
cd <dotGifIt-root-directory>
mvn clean install
java -jar target/dot-gif-it-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
